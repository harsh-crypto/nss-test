                    <p className = "content"> NSS - National Service Scheme is a scheme under the Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports. It was started involving 37 Universities and 40,000 students in them. Today NSS has over 3.86 million students enrolled in 41,442 NSS units. The scheme was launched in Gandhiji's Centenary year, 1969. NSS was started to establish a meaningful linkage between the campus and the community. The overall aim of NSS is to give an extension dimension to the higher education system and orient the student youth to community service while they are studying in an educational institution. The reason for the formulation of this objective is the general realization that University students tend to get alienated from the village/slum masses which constitute the majority of the population of the country. Therefore it is necessary to arouse the social conscience of the students and to provide them an opportunity to work with the people in the villages and slums. It is felt that their interaction with the common villagers and slum dwellers will expose them to the realities of life and bring about a change in their social perception. Student youth, teachers, and the community are considered the three basic components of the National Service Scheme.
 
 NSS believes in the motto ‚ÄúNOT ME BUT YOU‚Äù.This reflects the essence of democratic living and upholds the need for selfless service and appreciation of the other person‚Äôs point of view and also to show consideration for fellow human beings. It underlines that the welfare of an individual is ultimately dependent on the welfare of society on the whole. Therefore, it should be the aim of the NSS to demonstrate this motto in its day-to-day program.
  
 Aims of NSS Programmes/Activities The operational aim of NSS is to integrate the three basic components of the program. NSS programs should provide a variety of learning experiences which must develop a sense of participation, service, and achievement among the volunteers. The activities should aim at the following:
 Making education more relevant to the present situation to meet the felt needs of the community and supplement the education of the university/college students by bringing them face to face with the rural situation.
 Providing opportunities to the students to play their role in planning and executing development projects which would not only help in creating durable community assets in rural areas and urban slums but also result in the improvement of quality of life of the economically and socially weaker sections of the community.
 Encouraging students and non-students to work together along with the adults in rural areas.
 Developing qualities of leadership by discovering the latent potential among the campers, both students as well as local youth (Rural and Urban), to involve them more intimately in the development program and also to ensure proper maintenance of the assets created during the camps;
 Emphasizing dignity of labour and self-help and the need for combining physical work with intellectual pursuits;
 Encouraging youth to participate enthusiastically in the process of national development and promote national integration, through corporate living and cooperative action.
 While undertaking these activities, each NSS unit should envisage its programs/activities aimed at instilling discipline, building character, promoting physical fitness, and developing culture.
